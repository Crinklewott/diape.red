Hey all!

My name is [Archenoth](//archenoth.com/about), and I am a certified weirdo!

...well *not literally*, I don't have a certificate or anything--so that isn't technically true. But, you see, I'm what's known as an "[AB/DL](/faq#wait-do-you-actually-like-wearing-diapers)", and what that means is that I really, honest-to-god, like to wear diapers!

<style>
  @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    img[alt=SleepyWott]{
      float: right;
      margin-left: 5%;
      margin-bottom: 5%;
      max-width: 50%;
    }
  }
</style>

As you could probably imagine, there are people who find this fact about me a little unusual, so the topic of this site is about my adventures living outside the status quo~

I plan to cover topics ranging from what it's like having a kink that places you squarely outside of all but the most accepting groups, as well as about my experiences coming out so I didn't have to feel slightly sad all hours of the day. I may even write some how-tos that other people like me might find fun, or some explanations for people who just don't "get it"!

I hope you all enjoy this site!

# Me, but elsewhere
If you want to see other things I'm up to, here are a few other places you can see just that!

  projects, weird thoughts, and ideas.
