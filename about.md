Hey all!

My name is [Archenoth](//archenoth.com/about), and I'm a certified weirdo!

...well, I don't have a certificate or anything--so that isn't technically true. But, you see, I'm what's known as an "ABDL", and what that means is that [wearing diapers is something that makes me happy!](/faq#wait-do-you-actually-like-wearing-diapers)

![Sleepywott](/img/Sleepywott.png "Sleepywott!")
<style>
  @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    img[alt=Sleepywott]{
      float: right;
      margin-left: 5%;
      margin-bottom: 5%;
      max-width: 50%;
    }
  }

  img[alt='the favicon for archenoth.com']{
    display: inline-block;
    width: 16px;
    height: 16px;
  }
</style>

As you could probably imagine, there are people who find this fact about me a little unusual, so the topic of this site is about my adventures living outside the status quo~

I plan to cover topics ranging from what it was like [accepting a quirk like this as a part of my identity](/faq#are-you-ashamed-of-your-diaper-wearing), as well as about my experiences [tailoring my spaces](/faq#how-do-you-deal-with-telling-people-about-your-quirks) to be ones where I could exist comfortably. I may even write some how-tos that other people like me might find fun, or some explanations for people who just don't "get it"!

If you're more interested my drawings and sketches, I have [an art page](/diapart)! Not everything in there is ABDL, and in fact, I don't ever really draw anything explicit. (Though, I also don't think 100% of what's in there could be set as your wallpaper without raising some eyebrows)

Anywho, without further ado, I hope you all enjoy this site!
