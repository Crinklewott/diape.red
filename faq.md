# Wait, do you actually *like* wearing diapers?
I do! And in fact, I wear them by choice~

To me, they just feel nice to wear! There's something about having one on that just feels "right"; a sort of completeness that makes me just a tiny bit happier every second I am diapered.

Also, I think they're cute, and find anyone wearing them instantly 100 times cuter--and I like being cute!

It's a little hard to explain if you don't find diapers cute yourself, but to me, their very existence just radiates good vibes, and actually being able to have them on 100% of the time just makes me feel wonderful.

# Is this a sex thing?
I'm actually demisexual, so sex itself doesn't really appeal to me outside of very specific circumstances. That makes labelling this as a "fetish" kind of hard for me, because for me, it's mostly to do with inherently aesthetic sensibilities.

Basically, I find diapers cute--I also find people wearing diapers cute, and I like to feel cute!
There's also an embarrassment aspect of it that I also find cute, since I find blushing adorable.

Even so, I can't deny that diapers are a part of my sexuality, but I think something really important people miss about sexuality is that it stretches waaay beyond the bounds of just sex. For example, when a couple enjoys each others' company, or hugs, that's not simply because of sex reasons--but that relationship is inherently a part of human sexuality. There is a lot more to it than simply things that happen in the bedroom.

So, while you can't really dismiss this as simply a "sex thing", it's still very much a part of my sexuality.

# Do you use your diapers?
Sometimes! But I also don't like things that smell bad, and don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable, so I'm very conscientious of that.

That said, there are times when bathroom breaks are extremely troublesome to do, and depending on how much trouble it would be, it's not the worst tradeoff in the world. I mean, wetting yourself isn't really the end of the world when you're wearing a diaper, especially if you can clean yourself and change before long.

I mean, you mostly don't ever *need* to use it--but the option is always there for when times are desperate and things get really uncomfortable.

# Are you ashamed of your diaper wearing?
I definitely used to be. I think when you have something that others might consider strange, it's easy to make it seem like bigger deal to yourself than it actually is.

It's pretty easy to fall into the trap to think that anything out of the ordinary is deviant and must be suppressed, but liking diapers is as harmless as liking cartoons--and can add a tiny bit of ambient joy to your life if it's something that you enjoy! (And anything like that can really add up!)

It's easy to think that others will immediately be disgusted, you'll be excommunicated, or that this sort of thing can ruin your life. I was scared enough that I used to literally only ever interact with others like me through an encrypted VM with an entirely separate identity, because, "what if anyone ever found out??"

I was legit scared.

Accepting yourself can be extremely hard sometimes, especially if you come from places that don't have terribly progressive views and you become paranoid about being different in any discernible way from the so-called "norm".

I grew up in a place like that, and I had the impression that I would have been drawn and quartered for even simply liking *Pok√©mon*. So what hope would an obscure kink have of getting accepted in an environment like that?

Nowadays though? I'll gladly admit I wear diapers if someone cares enough to ask! It's not nearly as weird as I thought it was--diapers are actually a very human thing to wear, and most people aren't nearly as judgmental of harmless things as I had feared they might be.

I'm not ashamed, and you should try really hard to not be either.

# What if people aren't accepting as you hoped?
I noticed that, most of the time, people won't react nearly as bad as you fear they will. This is *especially* true if you have any previous dialog with them. Turns out, people that know you have already judged your character, and something like this isn't likely to change their opinion of you as much as you'd think.

But even if their reaction is negative, it's only a single data point on a vast array of things they know about you--and they will likely grow more comfortable with the idea over time. Liking diapers isn't nearly the kind of relationship kryptonite that every AB/DL seems to initially assume!

You can still love, you can still be loved, and you don't even need to isolate yourself with other AB/DLs to do that.
